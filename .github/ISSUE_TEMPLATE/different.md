- what IS tidy data: each variable is a column and each column is a variable. each observation is a row and each row is an observation. each value is a cell and each cell is a single value. 
- data lengthening: use pivot_longer(), ex: billboard |> pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"), names_to = "week", values_to = "rank"). {cols are what need to be pivoted (which columns aren't variables), names_to names the variable stored in the column names, and values_to names the variable stored in the cell values.}
- values can be dropped with values_drop_na=TRUE
- parse_number extracts the first number from a string, ignoring all other text
- review wtf .value actually does (5.3.4)
- data widening: use pivot_longer(): ex:
